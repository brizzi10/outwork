I want to feel like I am receiving a customized workout.
I want to be able to track my progress through the drills.
I want to compare myself with other users competing the same drills.
I want to be able to select a wide variety of drills, not just ones for my position.
I want some type of instruction provided for each drill.
I want to be able to access the app with my cell phone, so that I can refer to it during a workout.
I want the app to be incredibly easy to use, so that I can focus on the drills themselves.
